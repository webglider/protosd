## Prototype SD card image writer for linux
This is a prototype nw.js app which provides a GUI allowing users to write .img files to SD cards connected to linux systems and also keeps track of the progress by displaying it on a progress bar. With this the user will not have to touch the terminal.

###Usage
##### Note: 
The app does not work properly on nw.js v0.11.x due to this issue: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/272
**Please use nw.js v0.10.5 or lower (tested on v0.10.5)**
##### Warning: 
This is a prototype and all errors may not be handled properly

-Simply download/clone and run nw on the protosd directory
-Choose the disk corresponding to your SD card (you can remove and re-insert and refresh to find out)
-Browse for your .img file and locate it
-Press the Write Image button, watch the progress and wait for it to complete.
